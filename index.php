	<p>Boites is an introverted & automated social media application.</p>

	<p>The idea, is to have a real world social media application that is an equivalent of a 'god-mode' or 'book of truth' that contains all our data.</p>

	<h4>Four examples:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>If watching a TV show on a streaming platform, the show, streaming service, start & end time, season & episode should all be automatically updated to my Boites personal profile page.</li>
		<li>If I order take-out at a fast food chain such as Burger King or Swiss Chalet. My order should automatically be uploaded to my profile page.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If a mother takes her two childen Bobby & Suzy out for an easy supper. After ordering if not 100% automatic, she should be able to easily click who got what meal, and their nutrition is updated. </li>
		</ul>
		<li>A gym of the future. Instead of manually entering in all my work out data. How much weight, reps, sets, and what exercise. It's conceivable it should be possible to completely automate that process. Making it easier for me to actually acquire some intel to allow me further understanding of how I'm processing.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If on my 7th attempt of doing an exercise I hit a weight Personal Best (PB) of 110lbs. But for the next 4 weeks I'm unable to hit that PB again, why?</li>
			<li>Maybe it's because I did that exercise 1st instead of last because the machine I normally would start with was occupied. This is information that is pertinent and matters to a gym-goers goals. This should be outputted into my Boites account.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	
	<p>I like to compare day to day life as a person right now as showing up to a professional level sporting event with zero data, while our opposition has a full data set of their and our playstyle.
	You're likely to get defeated easily. Stats matter. Yet that's how we live our lives everyday when we should, or could, know better.
	Boites, my final co-op project idea for my time as an IMDW student at Georgian College is an attempt to remedy that.
	All this information should be consolidated into one spot.</p>

	<p>Which brings us to this home page description to why or what the Crown log is.</p>

	<p>I apologize for a Boites module topic on the vulgar side for a school project.
	If attempting to build a social media application that automatically tracks all of our data.
	Our sexuality is one piece or module of all that data, the Crown Log is my attempt at branding something personal and attempting to make it sound like conferring royalty or class. [Thinking about female derogatory remarks and other pro-choice groups when considering patterns in people behaviour]</p>

	<p>Name:
	Is not a form entry selection for this project because it wouldn't make sense their in the scope of this project.
	A module is one part or component of anyone's entire Boites social media profile. Meaning it's already connected to their name. Unless we're adding the names of other participants, which brings up privacy or human rights concerns worth discussing. It doesn't make sense to be added here, the crown log should already be connected to the individuals name.</p>

	<p><small>ps: The obvious alternative to the crown log is &#x1F496; "The Ministry of Love" &#x1F499;
- That is way too obvious, uninspired, and I believe the I.P properties of George Orwell.</small></p>

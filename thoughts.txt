I liked the version where I intentionally left out categories.

I wanted that first one to have this idea of 'why, who cares, does it matter?'

But I don't know how to attempt a finished product without including that fact.

Now that I am, it makes me joking comments all the more inappropiate because if I select the homosexual category

It says that same statement "Ew, gross. Something rude happened here."
